<h1>Radiocarbon Dating the Neolithic in the UK</h1>
This project, completed for Interactive Geovisualiation, is an interactive map which allows users to explore over 10,000 years of radiocarbon dates gathered from 62 excacation sites in the UK, comprising some 1800+ artifacts across 2100 5-year timestamp intervals.

This project's most notable feature is the custom time slider, which was written to overcome the limitations of working with such a large timescale at variable playback speeds while allowing for play/pause, scroll, and restart behavior.

<h2>Project Features</h2>

* Proportional symbol presentation varies size of marker according to probability of sample dating to the year currently in view
* This allows for an intuitive exploration of highly abstract scientific data (sampled radiocarbon probability analysis)
* Supplementals provide contextual information on project scope and interpretation of results
* Supplementals contain appropriate graphics and embedded carousels
* Custom-written timeline and playback controls allow for effortless exploration of data
* Playback controls allow for variations in speed, independent dragging, restarting to beginning when played from end, etc.
* Control panel on right sidebar enables contextual marker highlighting based on sample's recorded archaeological culture identification
* Era and symbol size legend callouts provide additional context to aid interperetation
* Custom Mapbox tileset used to enhance visual contrast of presentation
* Custom graphics and design elements (website background, etc.)
* Full academic attributions are included
